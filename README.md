# LoadN
Want to fake productivity? Try out LoadN. LoadN is a compilation of static loading screens for commonly used websites. You can't work if your website isn't loading. Is it missing a website that you would like to see? PM me and i'll see if I can add it.

# Support
* [X] Quizlet
* [X] Canvas
* [X] Google Docs (home page and document)
* [ ] Google Drive (Formatting is messed up)

# Hosting
If you want to host the website on your own, in index.html, please change
```/LoadN/quizlet/Quizlet%20Live%20Quizlet.html```
to
```/quizlet/Quizlet%20Live%20Quizlet.html```
and repeat the same step for each of the other buttons. Github pages messes with the sub pages so they have to be different.
